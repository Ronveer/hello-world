# hello-world
Greetings, fellow Earthlings.
I'm just a student biologist/naturalist in training. A seed for coding was planted in my mind when I started using some programs for phylogenetics... With technology growing exponentially, it would really be a shame if I didn't have some coding skills in my repertoire. That is why I'm here. Hello World! :)
